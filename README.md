# Hi, I'm Alex! 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in software, firmware, machine learning, and computer architecture. I love exploring the intersection between low-level programming and intelligent systems, and I'm always excited to learn something new.

Some of my favorite projects so far:
- 🗣️ **Networking chat in Python**: Built from scratch to better understand sockets and real-time communication.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Testing (ML_testing)**: Experimenting with keyword spotting (KWS) for my final year project.

My main interests include:
- Low-level programming (anything close to the hardware!)
- Data science and machine learning
- Systems and architecture

I'm always open to collaborating, learning, or just chatting about tech. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alexmak7)!

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
