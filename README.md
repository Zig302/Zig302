# Hi, I'm Alex! 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in software, firmware, machine learning, and computer architecture. 
I love exploring the intersection between low-level programming and intelligent systems.

My main interests include:
- Low-level programming (anything close to the hardware!)
- Data science and machine learning
- Systems and architecture


Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
